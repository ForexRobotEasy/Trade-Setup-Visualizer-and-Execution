# Trade Setup Visualizer and Execution

This code is a part of the Trade Setup Visualizer and Execution program developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The program provides a lightweight trade manager, inspired by TradingView, that offers an intuitive platform for traders to position orders and manage risks.

## How It Works

The code includes several functions that perform different tasks:

1. The `CalculateRisk` function calculates the risk based on the trader's equity and pip spread choices. It takes the equity and pip spread as parameters and returns the volume based on the risk percentage chosen by the trader.

2. The `DisplayCalculatedRisk` function displays the calculated risk on the chart. It takes the calculated risk and the selected instrument as parameters. It creates a text object on the chart with the calculated risk information.

3. The `AdjustEntryPositions` function is a placeholder for implementing the visual representation of trade settings and allowing traders to adjust entry positions using square anchors. This function can be customized based on specific requirements.

The `OnStart` function is the entry point of the program. It retrieves the trader's equity and pip spread choices, calculates the risk using the `CalculateRisk` function, and displays the calculated risk on the chart using the `DisplayCalculatedRisk` function. It then calls the `AdjustEntryPositions` function to allow traders to adjust entry positions.
